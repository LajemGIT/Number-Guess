# Number Guessing Game

This is a Number Guessing Game that I created as part of my learning process to enhance my web development skills. It allows users to guess a randomly generated number within different difficulty levels, ranging from easy to "impossible" challenges.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is learning and experimentation. I used this project to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and to explore various design and animation techniques. The game was created to be visually engaging and fun, but it's fundamentally a simple number guessing game.

## Features

- Multiple Difficulty Levels: From easy (1 to 50) to "impossible" (1 to 1,000,000).
- Neon Themed Design: With various animations and effects like glowing text and pulsing buttons.
- Interactive UI: Users input their guess, and the game will respond with hints (too high, too low, or correct).
- Score Tracking: Your score increases with every correct guess.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure and content of the game.
- CSS: Styling and animations (including neon effects, pulsing buttons, and glow effects).
- JavaScript: Core game logic, including random number generation and user interaction.

## How to Play

1. Open the game on Git Pages (see 'where you can play')
2. Choose a difficulty level (easy, normal, hard, or impossible or the uhm see for yourself).
3. Enter a number in the input field.
4. Press the "Check The Number" or Press Enter button.
5. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
6. Keep guessing until you get it right, and see your score increase!
